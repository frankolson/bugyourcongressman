# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#

        paragraph_1:
          Hello. I’m a constituent from your district and I’m very concerned
          about the ongoing violence police officers are using against
          civilians.
        paragraph_2:
          I ask you to please support and consider co-sponsoring
          Rep. Amash’s “Ending Qualified Immunity Act” to restore Americans’
          rights to seek relief when their civil rights are violated. If the
          President won’t sign it, please make every attempt to override a
          veto. Americans will not tolerate special protections for abuses of
          power by corrupt or violent officers.
        paragraph_3:
          I’ll be eagerly looking for your public announcement of support.
          And I’ll certainly be voting in November with this issue in mind.
          Thank you for your time and consideration.

      title: What is Qualified Immunity?
      quotation:
        content:
          Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, public officials are held
          to a much lower standard. They can be held accountable only insofar
          as they violate rights that are “clearly established” in light of
          existing case law.
        authors: Amir H. Ali and Emily Clark in
        summary_html:
          'In other words, unless you can prove that a cop violated your
          rights, <em>and</em> another cop has been successfully sued for that
          same violation, your case will likely get thrown out. Here is
          another good description of what that means:'
