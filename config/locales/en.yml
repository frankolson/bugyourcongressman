# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

        subtitle:
          The House of Representatives just passed this bill which, "addresses a
          wide range of policies and issues regarding policing practices and law
          enforcement accountability". Now it's up to the Senate. Call your
          Senator and let them know this is an important issue for you.

            I’m very concerned about the ongoing violence police officers are

      title: What is Qualified Immunity?
      quotation:
        content:
          Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, public officials are held
          to a much lower standard. They can be held accountable only insofar
          as they violate rights that are “clearly established” in light of
          existing case law.
        authors: Amir H. Ali and Emily Clark in
        summary_html:
          'In other words, unless you can prove that a cop violated your
          rights, <em>and</em> another cop has been successfully sued for that
          same violation, your case will likely get thrown out. Here is
          another good description of what that means:'

      title: What is Congress?
      intro:
        paragraph_1:
          It is the legislative branch of the United States federal government.
          Put simply, it is responsible for making our nation's laws.
        paragraph_2:
          Interestingly, of the three main branches of our government, it is the
          only one that is elected directly by the American people. This gives
          us citizens a lot of power.
      house:
        title: The House of Representatives
        logo_alt_text: Seal of the United States House of Representatives
        description:
          paragraph_1:
            In the House, each state has some representatives proportional to
            their population. The more people a state has, the more
            representatives it gets.
          paragraph_2:
            Each representative serves a two year term. Because each term is so
            short, representatives are constantly considering the opinion of
            the people. If not, they would be voted out quickly.
          powers:
            title: "The House's special powers include:"
            first: Impeaching the president
            second: Deciding a presidential elections if there is a tie
            third: Any bills regarding taxes start in the House
      senate:
        title: The Senate
        logo_alt_text: Seal of the United States Senate
        description:
          paragraph_1:
            In the Senate, each state has the same number of senators, two.
            Therefore, each state is represented equally.
          paragraph_2:
            Each senator serves a six year term. The reason for the longer
            terms, according to the founding fathers, was to allow the senators
            to debate and think through issues, without being too affected by
            swaying public opinion.
          powers:
            title: "The Senate's special powers include:"
            first: Holding impeachment trials
            second: Signing treaties
            third:
              Confirming special offices in the government like federal judges
      two_parts:
        title: Why does Congress even have two parts?
        description:
          paragraph_1:
            Well, the founding fathers were concerned that Congress would have
            too much power. So they split it up and made it so each part had
            power over the other.
          paragraph_2:
            A bill (proposal for a law) can start in either the Senate or the
            House. In each case it is debated, revised, and debated some more.
            Once that is finished, it has to go through the same process in the
            other part of Congress. Because each part can check the other,
            neither gets too much power.
          paragraph_3: Once both sides agree, you have a law!
